# Plant-Disease-Deep_Learning
Deep learning CNN models to identify diseased plants. Applications in agriculture and wildlife preservation. 
Includes an ensemble model of 3 pretrained models (all from Kaggle) and a model made from scratch using the plant_leaves dataset from tensorflow datasets. 
A Gradio app is included at the end of the notebooks that takes plant leaf images from the web and classifies them as either healthy or diseased.
